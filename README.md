//QUESTION 1:Simulate and implement stop and wait protocol for noisy channel.(SET-2)

DESCRIPTION:
Stop – and – Wait protocol for noisy channel is data link layer protocol for data communications with error control and flow control mechanisms.
This protocol takes into account the facts that the receiver has a finite processing speed and that frames may get corrupted while transmission.
The sender sends the next frame only when it has received a positive acknowledgment from the receiver that it is available for further data processing. Otherwise, it waits for a certain amount of time and then resends the frame.

//QUESTION 2:Simulate and implement selective repeat sliding window protocol.(SET-2)

DESCRIPTION:

This protocol(SRP) is mostly identical to GBN protocol, except that buffers are used and the receiver, and the sender, each maintains a window of size.
SRP works better when the link is very unreliable.
SRP also requires full-duplex link. backward acknowledgments are also in progress.
